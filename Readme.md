Martin's Collection of Code Snippets
====================================

This is just what it says -- a cache for me to dump code snippets.
Most often it's stuff I need to look up, reminders how to do things...
that kind of stuff.

I'm *not* asking for contributions etc. Maybe I'm using a sub-optimal
algorithm somewhere -- it's entirely possible I don't know that, but
usually, I have these examples in there for a good reason.
Extreme errors, however, should not be in here so if you find one
and tell me about it, that's highly appreciated.
